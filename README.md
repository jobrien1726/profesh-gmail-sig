## Instructions

Step 1: Clone repo to your desktop.

Step 2: Open in VSC or app of your choice and modify the info so that it pertains to you. Make sure any photos you use can be found somewhere on the internet (ie "src" is a url).

Step 3: Open signature.html in any browser.

Step 4: Select All and Copy your signature. 

Step 5: Open Gmail in a browser that ISN'T CHROME (Chrome will auto change your signature when you hit "save" so that links are underlined and it's frustrating, so use Safari or something).

Step 6: Go to your Gmail Settings and scroll down to Signature. 

Step 7: Create new signature, name it, and Paste in your Signature. 

Step 8: Hit "save changes" at the bottom. Now your email will contain a signature in any browser, including Chrome, and the formatting won't be compromised. 

**Note**: There is a limit of 10,000 characters in Gmail Signature. Make sure you don't go too overboard!
